Bizum is a name you'll hear everywhere in Spain when it comes to payments. It's a mobile payment service that has quickly established itself as the primary means of instant payment between individuals and has profoundly changed transaction habits in the country. Here's everything you need to know about this system.

## 1. What is Bizum?

Bizum is not a bank nor a standalone application that you download separately (like PayPal or Lydia). It's a peer-to-peer (P2P) instant payment service created by a consortium of Spain's major banks.

Its main objective is to enable immediate money transfers between individuals using only their phone number. It's directly integrated into the mobile application of your own Spanish bank.

## 2. How Does Bizum Work?

Bizum's operation is based on simplicity and instantaneity:

### Account-Phone Link

During activation (which is done through your bank's application), you link your mobile phone number to a Spanish bank account (IBAN). A phone number can only be linked to one IBAN at a time.

### P2P Transfer

1. You open your bank's application (Santander, BBVA, CaixaBank, etc.).
2. You access the "Bizum" section.
3. You choose "Send money".
4. You select the recipient from your contact list or enter their phone number.
5. You enter the amount and a brief description.
6. You validate the transaction (usually with an SMS code or your bank authentication).

### Reception

The money is transferred from your account to the recipient's account in less than 10 seconds. The recipient receives a notification (often by SMS) confirming that the money is immediately available in their account.

## 3. Main Uses of Bizum

While Bizum started as a P2P service, its functionalities have expanded:

### Peer-to-Peer Payments (P2P)

This is the most common and dominant use. Ideal for reimbursing a friend for dinner, sharing the cost of a gift, or paying your share of rent. The expression "Te hago un Bizum" ("I'll send you a Bizum") has replaced "I'll make you a transfer".

### Online Payments (E-commerce)

More and more Spanish e-commerce sites offer Bizum as a payment option. When paying, you enter your phone number, then validate the transaction directly in your banking application.

### In-Store Payments

Although less common than card payment, it's possible to pay in some physical stores, often by scanning a QR code.

### Donations to NGOs

A simplified system allows instant donations to registered charitable organizations.

## 4. Key Advantages

### Instantaneity

Funds are available in the recipient's account within seconds, 24/7.

### Free of Charge

For individuals, P2P transfers via Bizum are generally free and without commission.

### Simplicity

No need to ask for or enter an IBAN (24-digit account number). A simple phone number is enough.

### Security

The service is backed by the robust security systems of Spanish banks and complies with European regulations (strong authentication).

### Massive Adoption (Market Standard)

With over 20 million users and support from almost all banks in Spain (over 99% market share), it has become the de facto standard for P2P transfers. Almost everyone uses it.

## 5. Limits and Important Points

Bizum is not without rules. Limits are in place for security reasons:

- **Minimum amount per transaction**: €0.50
- **Maximum amount per transaction (P2P)**: Generally €500 (sometimes €1,000 depending on the bank).
- **Maximum amount received per day**: €2,000
- **Maximum number of transactions received per month**: 60 transactions.

> **Note**: These limits concern transactions between individuals. Limits for online merchant payments are different and generally higher.

### Major Restriction

Bizum is a purely Spanish service. You must have a bank account (IBAN) in Spain and a phone number (Spanish or foreign, but linked to the Spanish account) to activate it. It's not possible to use it with a French, Belgian, or other bank account.

## 6. Which Banks Offer Bizum?

Almost all banks operating in Spain offer it. This includes giants like:

- CaixaBank
- Santander
- BBVA
- Banco Sabadell
- ING
- Bankinter

And more than 30 other institutions.

## Conclusion

Bizum is much more than a simple payment method; it has established itself as the main mobile payment tool and a true social phenomenon in Spain. Its ease of use and instantaneity have made it indispensable for managing small daily expenses between friends and for online purchases, largely replacing cash and traditional bank transfers for these uses.
